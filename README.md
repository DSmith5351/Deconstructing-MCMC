# Deconstructing-MCMC
This repo consists of two related files.
The first, "MCMC Investigation.ipynb" runs examples of Markov chain Monte Carlo on finite, discrete state spaces.
It purpose is to illustrate the behavior of the Markov chain that MCMC creates, such as convergence to stationarity and the dependence between samples.

The second file, "A Discrete Investigation into Markov Chain Monte Carlo.pdf" is my explanation of whyu the MCMC algorithm works as it does. Starting from some reasonable assumptions, I derive the update formula in MCMC.
