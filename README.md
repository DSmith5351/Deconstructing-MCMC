# Deconstructing-MCMC
This repo consists of two related files.
The first, "MCMC Investigation.ipynb" runs examples of Markov chain Monte Carlo on finite, discrete state spaces.
It purpose is to illustrate the behavior of the Markov chain that MCMC creates, such as convergence to stationarity and the dependence between samples.
